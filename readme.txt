Android App Sharer let you share easily your android app on your blog posts.

Just write down the package name of the application you'll need to promote and place it between the [app] tag.

For example if you need to promote google maps ( <a href="https://market.android.com/details?id=com.google.android.apps.maps&feature=search_result">Market link google maps</a> ) which has com.google.android.apps.maps as package name, you only need to write <b>[app]com.google.android.apps.maps[/app]</b> in your blog post and it will generate:
<ul>
<li>QR Code</li>
<li>Appbrain link</li>
<li>Market link</li>
</ul>

Please note the Market link would work perfectly both from mobile and from pc.
